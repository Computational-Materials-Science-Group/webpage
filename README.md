The html files are automatically generated using `sphinx` by an implemented `GitHub` action
whenever one pushes changes to the `main` branch.

You can also generate the HTML documents by yourself on your local machine.
 
To generate the documents, first you should install the `sphinx` using pip module

    pip install sphinx
    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

Then, the document can be built by typing

    make html

in the root directory. The generated documents are available from

     html version : build -> html -> index.html

Enjoy :-)
